# magic-auth-context Example App

## Running the Example

Get a Magic API key, and set it as an environment variable by adding it to an .env.local file that looks like this:

```plaintext
VITE_MAGIC_API_KEY="pk_live_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

Run the example with `yarn start` in the `example/` directory.

You should be able to log in and log out with Magic just by going to http://localhost:3000!
